# PAM Authentication Module

This is a password authentication module ([PAM]) bridge from UNIX/Linux systems
to [XWiki].  This module was inspired by, modeled and written after the [LDAP
module].  The use case and mechanism is very similar.


## Motivation

This module addresses the need for systems that have a particular [PAM]
configuration and want to use it to authenticate users.  This was written by
the author because the [LDAP module] did not consistently function as described
in this [LDAP over SSL thread].  For those that use the [LDAP NSS] [PAM]
module, which both authenticate users on the OS itself, using this module
allows authentication to [XWiki] to LDAP via this software.
